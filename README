--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2 independent vertex categories:
-- RecoVertex: The jet contains one or more secondary vertices. Both infomation on tracks and SVs are used.
-- NoVertex: Containing jets not assigned to RecoVertex. Only the information of the selected tracks is used. 
	     The default value "-999" is assigned to the SV variables for jets belonging to this category.
	     
3 soft lepton categories, independent of the secondary vertex categories:
-- NoSoftLepton: Including jets without soft leptons found inside the jet;
-- SoftMuon: At least one soft muon was found inside the jet;
-- SoftElectron: No soft muon, but at least one soft electron was found inside the jet.

In my case, because of few events avaiable -> few leptons in jet, I've flagged the jet according to this definition but I've considered the lepton variables without distinction between muons and electron, e.g. I've considered "Number of leptons per jet" and not "Number of muons per jet"+"Number of electrons per jet". 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
the displaced tracks (and leptons, too) are ordered by decreasing 2D impact parameter significance (CONSIDERING THE SIGN)
the secondary vertices are ordered by increasing uncertainty on their 3D flight distance.

For track- and lepton-based variables, up to two tracks or leptons are used (if available), while for the secondary vertex variables only the first secondary vertex is used (if available).

Variabili estratte dai sample : 

	- vertex_cat : number of jets per vertex-category (numbers are associated to categories: "0" for novertex and "1" for recovertex).
	- lepton_cat : number of jets per lepton-category (numbers are associated to categories: "0" for nosoftlepton , "1" for softmuon,
			 "2" for softelectron).

- VARIABILI RELATIVE AI VERTICI SECONDARI:

	- n_trk_from_SV : The number of tracks associated with the first secondary vertex.
	- fd_sig_xy_SV  : The 2D flight distance significance of the first secondary vertex.
	- fd_sig_xyz_SV : The 3D flight distance significance of the first secondary vertex.
	- corrected_mass_SV : The corrected mass [ sqrt(M^2 + p^2*sin(theta)^2) + p*sin(theta)] for the first secondary vertex.
	- energy_ratio_SV : The secondary vertex energy ratio, defined as the energy of the secondary vertex with the smallest uncertainty on 					its flight distance divided by the energy of the total summed four-momentum vector of the selected tracks.
	- dR_SV_JET : The DR between the flight direction of the secondary vertex and the jet axis.
	- MassEnergyFraction_SV : The “massVertexEnergyFraction” variable, which is defined as X/(X +0.04), where X is the corrected secondary 					vertex mass divided by the average b meson mass multiplied by the scalar sum of the track energies for tracks 					associated with the secondary vertex divided by the scalar sum of the track energies for track associated 
				with the jet.
	- Boost_SV : The “vertexBoost” variable, defined as Y2/(Y2 + 10), where Y is the square root of the average b meson mass multiplied 				with the scalar sum of the track pT for tracks associated with the vertex, divided by the product of the corrected 				secondary vertex mass and the square root of the jet pT. This variable is related to the boost of the secondary vertex.
